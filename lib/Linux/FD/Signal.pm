#ABSTRACT: Signal filehandles for Linux

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Linux::FD::Signal;
 
 my $fh = Linux::FD::Signal->new($sigset, @flags);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module creates a filehandle that can be used to accept signals targetted at the caller, similar but not identical to L<Signal::Pipe|Signal::Pipe>. It provides an alternative to conventional signal handlers or C<sigwaitinfo>, with the advantage that the file descriptor may easily be monitored by mechanisms such as C<select>, C<poll>, and C<epoll>.

=method new($sigmask)

The $sigmask argument specifies the set of signals that the caller wishes to accept via the file descriptor. This should either be a signal name(without the C<SIG> prefix) or a L<POSIX::SigSet|POSIX> object. Normally, the set of signals to be received via the file descriptor should be blocked to prevent the signals being handled according to their default dispositions. It is not possible to receive SIGKILL or SIGSTOP signals via a signalfd file descriptor; these signals are silently ignored if specified in $sigmask. C<@flags> is an optional list of flags, currently limited to C<'non-blocking'> (requires Linux 2.6.27).

=method set_mask($sigmask)

Sets the signal mask to a new value. Its argument works exactly the same as C<new>'s

=method receive()

If one or more of the signals specified in mask is pending for the process, then it returns the information of one signalfd_siginfo structures (see below) that describe the signals.

As a consequence of the receive, the signals are consumed, so that they are no longer pending for the process (i.e., will not be caught by signal handlers, and cannot be accepted using sigwaitinfo).

If none of the signals in mask is pending for the process, then the receive either blocks until one of the signals in mask is generated for the process, or fails with the error C<EAGAIN> if the file descriptor has been made non-blocking.

The information is returned as a hashref with the following keys: C<signo>, C<errno>, C<code>, C<pid>, C<uid>, C<fd>, C<tid>, C<band>, C<overrun>, C<trapno>, C<status>, C<int>, C<ptr>, C<utime>, C<stime>, C<address>. All of these are returned as integers. Some of them are only useful in certain circumstances, others may not be useful from perl at all.
